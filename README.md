# Requirements:

- Start with empty grid X by Y(make it configurable)

- Tell the player to get ready, then highlight a number of cells (also configurable) for a few seconds while telling the user to memorize

- Game then goes into “Recall” mode, where the user is challenged to remember those cells after we clear the cells from the grid.

- If they guess a correct cell, mark it green, and if they guess a wrong cell, mark it red

- They win if they guess all the right cells with a maximum of two wrong attempts.
